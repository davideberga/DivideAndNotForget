CV
For 3 resnet, for 2 datasets
x = tasks
y = mean train/validation
(?)Accuracy Train/Validation --> Plot
Loss Train/Validation --> Plot

(1) Accuracy Agnostic --> Plot diagonal + plot last row (performance on model complete after all tasks)
(2) Accuracy Aware    --> Plot last row (plur or minus the value is the same for each row)
(3) Precision --> Plot test of each task (x axis)
(4) Recall --> Plot test of each task (x axis)

Both
Confusion Matrix without numbers, only colors, for 3 resnet,
for 2 datasets, for 2 architecture (baseline and final model)


WHAT NEED:
1 - real arrays
2 - prediction arrays
3 - after all training, reload all test dataset to perform real accuracy on whole dataset
